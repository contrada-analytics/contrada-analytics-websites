LINKEDIN POST IDEA #10: AI Governance for CPG: What You Need Before Regulations Hit

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG legal/compliance, CDOs, CIOs, risk management teams

HOOK:
The EU AI Act is here.
California's AI regulations are coming.
Your CPG company is using AI (whether you know it or not).

Do you have governance in place?

KEY POINTS:
- AI regulations are accelerating globally (EU AI Act, state-level US regulations)
- CPG-specific risks: trade secrets in retailer negotiations, consumer-facing AI, supplier data sharing
- Most companies have shadow AI usage they don't track
- Governance isn't about blocking innovation - it's about enabling safe, fast adoption
- Framework: Assess → Policy → Controls → Operating Model

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with regulatory landscape (creates urgency)
2. CPG-specific AI risks that other industries don't face
3. The governance gap: Most companies don't know where AI is being used
4. What happens without governance: Regulatory exposure, data breaches, reputational risk
5. The framework: Assessment, policy, controls, operating model
6. Implementation roadmap: 90-day plan to get governance in place
7. CTA: "Assess your AI governance maturity" or "Download CPG AI governance checklist"

CPG-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- Retailer data sharing agreements (can't expose competitive intelligence)
- Trade secret protection (pricing algorithms, promotional strategies)
- Consumer-facing AI (chatbots, personalization, product recommendations)
- Supplier collaboration platforms (who owns the data and models?)
- GDPR/CCPA compliance in consumer marketing

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK:
- Inventory of current AI usage across organization
- Risk assessment tailored to CPG concerns
- Policy development: acceptable use, model selection, vendor evaluation
- Data privacy and security controls
- Operating model: Who owns AI decisions? Who approves deployments?
- Vendor management: How to evaluate AI tools and ensure compliance

TONE: Practical, not alarmist. Governance enables innovation, doesn't block it.
