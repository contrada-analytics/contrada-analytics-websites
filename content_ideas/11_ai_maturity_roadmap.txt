LINKEDIN POST IDEA #11: The AI Maturity Roadmap: Where Are You?

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG executives, digital transformation leaders, innovation teams

HOOK:
Most CPG companies think they're "not ready for AI."

Actually, you're at one of four stages - and each stage has a clear next step.

Here's the roadmap.

KEY POINTS:
- Four stages: Reactive, Developing, Defined, Optimized
- Each stage has characteristics across people, process, technology, governance
- You don't need to be "mature" to start - you need to know where you are and what's next
- Self-assessment framework included
- Most mid-market CPG brands are in "Developing" stage - perfect for targeted interventions

STRUCTURE:
1. Open by debunking "not ready for AI" myth
2. Introduce the maturity framework (4 stages)
3. Describe each stage with CPG-specific examples
4. Self-assessment questions for each dimension (people, process, tech, governance)
5. What to do at each stage (practical next steps)
6. Case example: Company that went from Reactive to Defined in 12 months
7. CTA: "Take the AI maturity assessment" or "Where is your organization today?"

THE FOUR STAGES:

STAGE 1 - REACTIVE:
- People: No dedicated data/AI roles, ad-hoc analysis
- Process: Manual, Excel-based, no standards
- Technology: Disconnected systems, no data platform
- Governance: None
- Next step: Data inventory and use case prioritization

STAGE 2 - DEVELOPING:
- People: Small analytics team, limited AI expertise
- Process: Some automation, inconsistent across teams
- Technology: Basic BI tools, data still siloed
- Governance: Informal policies
- Next step: Build data platform, pilot 1-2 AI use cases

STAGE 3 - DEFINED:
- People: Established data/AI team, defined roles
- Process: Standardized, documented, some automation
- Technology: Integrated data platform, ML capabilities
- Governance: Formal policies, ethical guidelines
- Next step: Scale successful pilots, advanced analytics

STAGE 4 - OPTIMIZED:
- People: AI embedded across organization, continuous learning
- Process: Fully automated, AI-augmented decision-making
- Technology: Real-time data platform, production AI systems
- Governance: Comprehensive, continuously improving
- Next step: Innovation at the edge, competitive differentiation

SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS:
- How long does post-promotion analysis take? (hours vs. weeks)
- Where is your data stored? (Excel vs. centralized platform)
- Who makes decisions about AI tools? (ad-hoc vs. governed process)
- How many AI/ML models in production? (0, 1-3, 4-10, 10+)
