LINKEDIN POST IDEA #4: Trade Spend Optimization: The $10M Question

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG finance leaders, RGM teams, commercial directors

HOOK:
How much money are you leaving on the table because you can't see your promotional performance in real-time?

For most mid-market CPG brands, the answer is in the millions.

KEY POINTS:
- Trade spend is often 15-25% of revenue for CPG brands
- Without real-time visibility: decisions made on gut feel, promotional clashes go undetected, ROI unknown until it's too late
- 18% trade spend ROI improvement from case study
- The cost of one promotional clash can be $200K-500K in a major retailer

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with provocative question about money left on table
2. Break down the math: If you spend $50M on trade, 18% improvement = $9M
3. Explain what "blind spots" cost: promotional clashes, poor feature space optimization, delayed post-promo analysis
4. Share specific scenario: two customer teams running conflicting promotions at same retailer
5. The solution: real-time promotional analytics and coordination
6. CTA: "Calculate your trade spend opportunity" or "Book a trade spend audit"

SUPPORTING METRICS:
- +18% trade spend ROI (case study)
- 10x faster decision speed
- 120 hours/month saved on analysis

MAKE IT CONCRETE:
- Use specific dollar amounts
- Reference real promotional mechanics (feature space, price points, EDLP vs. Hi-Lo)
- Speak the language of trade teams
