LINKEDIN POST IDEA #23: Poll - What's Your Team's Biggest Data Bottleneck?

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG operations, analytics, commercial teams

HOOK:
Your team has the data.
But something is blocking you from using it effectively.

What's your biggest bottleneck? (Poll)

KEY POINTS:
- Interactive poll format drives engagement

- Each option resonates with different teams
- Comment section becomes valuable discussion forum
- Reveals industry pain points and common challenges
- Follow-up post analyzing poll results

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the premise (you have data, but can't use it)
2. Present the 4 poll options
3. Briefly explain each option
4. Ask for votes
5. Encourage comments about specific pain points
6. Follow up in comments with solutions for each bottleneck
7. Promise follow-up post with results and recommendations

POLL OPTIONS:

🔴 Data Collection
🟡 Data Integration
🟢 Data Analysis
🔵 Decision Making

POST TEXT:

Your team has data.

But somewhere between data and decisions, things break down.

Where's YOUR bottleneck?

🔴 DATA COLLECTION
You spend too much time gathering data from multiple sources
Manual exports from retailer portals, ERP, Excel files, emails
Before you can analyze anything, you need to collect everything

🟡 DATA INTEGRATION
You have the data, but it's scattered across systems
Different formats, different definitions, manual reconciliation required
Half your time goes to making data compatible

🟢 DATA ANALYSIS
Data is accessible, but turning it into insights takes too long
Complex Excel models, manual calculations, expert-dependent analysis
Bottleneck is interpretation, not availability

🔵 DECISION MAKING
You have insights, but decisions still take weeks
Approval chains, committee reviews, unclear decision rights
Analysis done quickly, but action happens slowly

VOTE + COMMENT:
Which bottleneck slows your team down most?
What's the specific pain point?

[LinkedIn Poll with 4 options above]

ENGAGEMENT IN COMMENTS:

After people vote and comment, engage with specific solutions:

FOR DATA COLLECTION (🔴):
"Automated data ingestion is the fastest ROI improvement. What sources are you manually collecting from? Most retailer portals have APIs you can leverage."

FOR DATA INTEGRATION (🟡):
"This is where a data platform pays for itself. The cost of manual reconciliation (time + errors) usually exceeds platform cost within 6 months. What systems are you integrating?"

FOR DATA ANALYSIS (🟢):
"If data is accessible but analysis is slow, you're ready for automated analytics or AI agents. What questions take the longest to answer?"

FOR DECISION MAKING (🔵):
"This is often an organizational issue, not a technical one. Where do decisions get stuck? (Approval chains? Unclear owners? Risk aversion?)"

FOLLOW-UP POST (1 week later):

"Last week I asked: What's your biggest data bottleneck?

Here's what 500+ CPG professionals said:

🔴 Data Collection: 35%
🟡 Data Integration: 40%
🟢 Data Analysis: 15%
🔵 Decision Making: 10%

The results show:

1. Most teams are still stuck in DATA WRANGLING (75% in collection + integration)
This is the tax you're paying before any value is created.

2. DECISION MAKING got lowest votes (10%), but this might be the biggest blind spot
Teams think the problem is data, but often it's organizational.

3. DATA ANALYSIS relatively low (15%) suggests most teams haven't solved collection/integration yet
You can't analyze what you can't access or integrate.

THE PATTERN:
Companies progress through stages:
Collection → Integration → Analysis → Decision Making

Most CPG companies are stuck in stages 1-2.
Leaders are in stages 3-4.

WHERE ARE YOU? AND WHAT'S THE FIX?
