SCORING:

TOTAL YOUR POINTS (0-20):

0-7 POINTS: REACTIVE
Where you are:
- Manual processes dominate
- Analysis lags decisions by weeks
- Frequent errors and firefighting
- Team overwhelmed by administrative work

Priority actions:
1. Automate promotional data collection (eliminate 50% of manual work)
2. Build centralized promotional calendar (prevent clashes)
3. Weekly RGM reviews instead of monthly/quarterly

Focus: Reduce administrative burden, increase decision frequency

8-14 POINTS: DEVELOPING
Where you are:
- Some automation in place
- Mix of manual and automated processes
- Decent visibility but not real-time
- Reactive more often than proactive

Priority actions:
1. Integrate data sources into single platform
2. Implement predictive analytics for key decisions
3. Accelerate insight-to-action cycle (days → hours)

Focus: Increase automation, improve predictive capability

15-20 POINTS: ADVANCED
Where you are:
- Highly automated processes
- Real-time visibility and decision-making
- Predictive analytics driving proactive decisions
- Strategic focus rather than administrative burden

Priority actions:
1. Implement AI agents for autonomous monitoring
2. Expand to adjacent use cases (pricing, assortment, etc.)
3. Share capabilities across organization

Focus: Scale best practices, continuous improvement

COMMON PATTERNS:

Most CPG companies score 6-12 (Reactive to Developing)

Biggest gaps (questions where most score 0-1):
- Q1: Data accessibility (still taking weeks)
- Q2: Data integration (still exporting from 5+ systems)
- Q6: Automation level (still 70%+ manual)
- Q9: Team capability (still spending most time on data wrangling)

Quick wins (highest ROI improvements):
- Automate promotional data ingestion (Q1, Q2) → Saves 100+ hours/month
- Build promotional calendar (Q5) → Prevents costly clashes
- Weekly reviews instead of monthly (Q3) → 4x faster learning cycles
