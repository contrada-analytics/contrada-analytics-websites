LINKEDIN POST IDEA #1: The Spreadsheet Tax: What Manual Processes Really Cost

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG/Retail commercial leaders, operations managers

HOOK:
Your team isn't slow. They're paying the Spreadsheet Tax.

KEY POINTS:
- Post-promotion analysis that should take hours stretches into weeks
- 120+ hours per month lost to manual data reconciliation (real client stat)
- Hidden costs: delayed decisions, missed opportunities, team burnout
- While your team reconciles last month's data, competitors are already optimizing next quarter

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with relatable pain point (team working late on spreadsheets)
2. Introduce "The Spreadsheet Tax" concept
3. Break down the real costs (time + opportunity cost + competitive disadvantage)
4. Share specific example from case study (anonymized if needed)
5. The alternative: automated systems that deliver insights in hours, not weeks
6. CTA: "What's your team's biggest time sink?" or "Book a 30-min call to calculate your Spreadsheet Tax"

SUPPORTING DATA:
- 120 hrs/month saved (case study)
- 10x faster decision speed
- Teams spending more time on reconciliation than strategy
