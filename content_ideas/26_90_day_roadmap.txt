LINKEDIN POST IDEA #26: From Manual to Automated: A 90-Day Roadmap

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG operations leaders, transformation teams, anyone starting automation journey

HOOK:
90 days.

That's how long it takes to go from "drowning in spreadsheets" to "automated insights."

Not 18 months. Not years. 90 days.

Here's the roadmap.

KEY POINTS:
- Practical 90-day implementation timeline
- Phased approach with quick wins
- Specific milestones and deliverables each month
- De-risks the transformation (prove value incrementally)
- Real example showing this is achievable
- Focus on promotional analytics as concrete use case

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the 90-day promise
2. Why 90 days (not shorter, not longer)
3. Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Foundation
4. Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Build & Pilot
5. Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Scale & Optimize
6. What happens after Day 90
7. Common mistakes that extend timeline
8. Real example of 90-day implementation
9. CTA: "Ready to start?" or "Download detailed roadmap"

WHY 90 DAYS?

TOO FAST (30 days):
- Insufficient foundation
- No time for learning/iteration
- Change management fails
- Technical shortcuts create issues

TOO SLOW (6-12 months):
- Organization loses momentum
- Priorities shift
- Team disengagement
- Opportunity cost accumulates

JUST RIGHT (90 days):
- Enough time to build properly
- Fast enough to maintain urgency
- Allows for one iteration cycle
- Delivers measurable value before enthusiasm wanes

PHASE 3: DAYS 61-90 (SCALE & OPTIMIZE)

WEEK 9-10: SCALE PREPARATION
Days 61-65: Rollout planning
- Assess pilot results
- Refine based on lessons learned
- Plan rollout sequence (remaining teams)
- Prepare training materials

Days 66-70: Scale infrastructure

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DAY 90:

DAYS 91-120: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
- Expand use cases (trade spend optimization, clash prevention)
- Add advanced analytics (predictive models)
- Further automation (exception-based alerts)
- Scale to adjacent areas

MONTHS 5-12: EXPANSION
- Add AI/ML capabilities
- Integrate additional data sources
- Build on success (other business processes)
- Become center of excellence

COMMON MISTAKES THAT EXTEND TIMELINE:

❌ MISTAKE #1: Boiling the ocean
Trying to automate everything at once
FIX: Start with ONE high-value use case

❌ MISTAKE #2: Analysis paralysis
Spending months on requirements and design
FIX: Working prototype in 30 days, iterate from there

❌ MISTAKE #3: Perfect data syndrome
Waiting for 100% data quality before launching
FIX: 80% data quality is enough to start, improve incrementally

❌ MISTAKE #4: Ignoring change management
Building great tech that no one adopts
FIX: Involve users from day 1, train extensively, support adoption

❌ MISTAKE #5: No executive sponsorship
Project gets deprioritized when challenges arise
FIX: Clear executive sponsor, regular steering committee updates

❌ MISTAKE #6: Big bang launch
Trying to go live with everyone on day 1
FIX: Pilot with 2 teams, prove value, then scale

REAL EXAMPLE:

RESULTS:
- 10x faster post-promotion analysis
