LINKEDIN POST IDEA #13: Why I Started DataArk Labs - Personal Story

TARGET AUDIENCE: Broad - executives, practitioners, potential clients and partners

HOOK:
I spent 20 years watching talented teams struggle with problems I knew how to solve.

Eventually, I had to do something about it.

KEY POINTS:
- Personal mission: Too many great teams held back by solvable data problems
- The frustration: Seeing the same preventable failures across companies
- The catalyst: Specific moment or project that pushed you to start DataArk Labs
- What's different: Practitioner experience, not external advisor perspective
- The goal: Help more teams move faster, decide better, achieve their potential

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the "why" - the emotional driver
2. Share background: 20+ years across CPG/retail, multiple roles (sales, marketing, engineering)
3. The pattern you kept seeing: Manual processes, delayed decisions, AI projects that never launch
4. Specific story/moment that crystallized the decision to start DataArk Labs
5. What you bring that others don't: Both commercial and technical depth
6. The mission: Use hard-won experience to help teams succeed
7. Where you are now: Clients getting real results, validation of the approach
8. CTA: "If this resonates, let's talk" or "What problem are you facing?"

THE STORY ARC:

THE BACKGROUND:
- Two decades in CPG/retail, global experience
- Wore many hats: sales, marketing, platform engineering, data teams
- Saw the industry from multiple angles

THE PATTERN:
- Every manual spreadsheet reconciliation
- Every delayed decision waiting for data
- Every AI initiative that delivered a demo but never went live
- Teams with talent and ambition, but trapped by tools and processes

THE FRUSTRATION:
- I knew these problems were solvable
- I'd solved many of them before
- But every new company was reinventing the wheel or making the same mistakes

THE CATALYST:
- [Specific story - could be a project that failed despite your best efforts]
- [Or a moment of clarity watching a talented team struggle unnecessarily]
- [Or a successful project that showed what's possible]

THE DECISION:
- Started DataArk Labs to focus exclusively on CPG/retail data transformation
- Not an advisor - a practitioner who builds solutions
- Mission: Help more teams achieve the success they're capable of

THE VALIDATION:
- Clients saving 120 hours/month, improving ROI by 18%, cutting errors by 94%
- Teams getting back to strategic work instead of spreadsheet wrangling
- Seeing the impact makes every challenge worth it

TONE: Authentic, mission-driven, personal but professional
