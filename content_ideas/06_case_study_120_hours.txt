LINKEDIN POST IDEA #6: "120 Hours Back Every Month" - Case Study

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG commercial teams, customer marketing leaders, operations managers

HOOK:
120 hours per month.

That's what this CPG manufacturer was losing to manual promotional data consolidation.

Here's how we got it back.

KEY POINTS:
- Challenge: 14 customer teams (8 UK, 6 Australia) manually tracking retailer promotional grids
- Data scattered across retailer portals, emails, PDFs, spreadsheets
- Post-promotion analysis taking 3-4 weeks instead of hours
- Result: Real-time promotional monitoring, clash prevention, 18% trade spend ROI improvement

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the 120 hours stat (makes it concrete)
2. Paint the "before" picture: teams drowning in spreadsheets, analysis always lagging
3. The breaking point: costly promotional clash that could have been prevented
4. The solution: Automated ingestion of retailer promotional grids, centralized dashboard
5. Implementation: 8 weeks from start to first team live
6. The "after" picture: Real-time visibility, proactive clash prevention, 10x faster decisions
7. Quantified results: 120 hrs/month saved, +18% trade spend ROI, 10x decision speed
8. CTA: "Is your team facing similar challenges?" or "Book a discovery call"

MAKE IT RELATABLE:
- Describe specific pain points (Friday afternoon scrambles, version control nightmares)
- Use quotes from team members (anonymized)
- Show before/after screenshots (if possible)
- Emphasize that this is a real company, real results

PROOF POINTS:
- 14 customer teams across two regions
- Real-time monitoring vs. 3-4 week delays
- Specific features: feature space tracking, catalogue activity, price monitoring, mechanic analysis
