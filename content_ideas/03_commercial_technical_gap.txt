LINKEDIN POST IDEA #3: The Commercial-Technical Gap

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG executives, RGM leaders, data transformation leaders

HOOK:
Most technical consultants don't understand commercial reality.
Most commercial advisors can't evaluate technical feasibility.
This gap is costing CPG brands millions.

KEY POINTS:
- Technical teams build elegant solutions that commercial teams never adopt
- Commercial teams request features that are technically impossible or prohibitively expensive
- The sweet spot: someone who's sat in retailer negotiations AND architected data platforms
- Real example: RGM system that technically worked but didn't align with how sales teams actually make decisions

STRUCTURE:
1. Set up the problem: two languages not communicating
2. Share personal story: wearing both hats (sales/marketing AND platform engineering)
3. Specific example of misalignment and its cost
4. What changes when someone understands both sides
5. How this shows up in project outcomes (adoption rates, ROI, user satisfaction)
6. CTA: "Which side of the gap are you on?" or "Let's bridge this gap together"

PERSONAL CREDIBILITY:
- Led platform and data engineering teams
- Held sales and marketing roles across multiple regions
- Sat in retailer negotiations
- Built commercial systems that actually get used

TONE: Positioning unique value prop without being arrogant

HASHTAGS: #CPG #RGM #DataStrategy #CommercialExcellence #TechLeadership
