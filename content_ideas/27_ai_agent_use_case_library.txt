LINKEDIN POST IDEA #27: AI Agents That Actually Work: A CPG Use Case Library

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG operations, IT leaders, innovation teams, anyone exploring AI agents

HOOK:
"AI agents" sounds like sci-fi.

But they're already working in CPG companies—automating workflows that used to take hours.

Here are 12 proven use cases with real results.

KEY POINTS:
- Demystify AI agents with concrete, proven examples
- Focus on CPG-specific workflows
- Each use case includes: problem, how agent works, results
- Mix of complexity (easy to advanced)
- Practical implementation guidance
- Shows what's possible today, not theoretical future

STRUCTURE:
1. Open by making AI agents concrete and real
2. What is an AI agent (simple definition)
3. 12 use cases organized by business function
4. Each use case: Problem → Agent solution → Results
5. Implementation complexity rating
6. Getting started guidance
7. CTA: "Which use case would help your team?" or "Explore AI agent pilot"

WHAT IS AN AI AGENT?

Simple definition:
An AI agent is software that autonomously performs tasks that typically require human judgment.

Unlike simple automation (if X then Y), agents can:
- Handle ambiguity and exceptions
- Learn from patterns
- Make contextual decisions
- Explain their reasoning
- Work with unstructured data

Key characteristic: Human-in-the-loop (agents recommend, humans approve/override)
