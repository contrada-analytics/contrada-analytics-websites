LINKEDIN POST IDEA #9: Promotional Clash Prevention 101

TARGET AUDIENCE: Customer marketing managers, trade marketing teams, category managers

HOOK:
A promotional clash just cost one of your competitors $400K.

They had two customer teams running conflicting promotions at the same retailer.
Same category. Same week. Different mechanics. Different price points.

The retailer was furious. Both promotions underperformed.

Here's how to prevent this.

KEY POINTS:
- What is a promotional clash: Overlapping promotions that cannibalize each other or confuse retailers/consumers
- Why they happen: Siloed customer teams, manual calendars, no centralized visibility
- Types of clashes: Geographic, temporal, mechanic, category, price point
- Real cost: Lost revenue + damaged retailer relationships + wasted trade spend
- Prevention: Real-time promotional calendar with automated clash detection

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with dramatic example of clash and its cost
2. Define promotional clashes and why they're more common than you think
3. Break down the types of clashes (with CPG-specific examples)
4. The root cause: organizational structure + manual processes
5. The solution: Centralized promotional calendar with rules engine
6. How it works: Automated alerts when team A's promotion conflicts with team B's plan
7. Implementation: What you need (data, rules, workflow, governance)
8. CTA: "How many clashes happened last year?" or "Request clash audit"

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:
- Feature space clash: Two teams both booking end-aisle at same retailer same week
- Price point clash: Premium SKU on promotion same week as value SKU
- Mechanic clash: BOGO conflicting with multi-buy
- Catalogue activity clash: In-store promo conflicting with e-commerce campaign

PREVENTION FRAMEWORK:
- Centralized promotional calendar (all teams, all retailers)
- Rule-based clash detection (configure your own business rules)
- Approval workflows (escalation when clash detected)
- Retailer-level coordination (ensure alignment with retailer priorities)
