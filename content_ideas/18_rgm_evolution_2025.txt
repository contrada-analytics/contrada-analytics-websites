LINKEDIN POST IDEA #18: RGM in 2025: From Excel to AI Agents

TARGET AUDIENCE: RGM leaders, pricing managers, revenue management teams, CPG executives

HOOK:
Revenue Growth Management in 2025 looks nothing like it did in 2015.

Excel → BI Tools → Predictive Analytics → AI Agents

We're at an inflection point. Here's what's changing.

KEY POINTS:
- Evolution of RGM tools and capabilities over past decade
- Current state: Most CPG companies still in "BI Tools" phase
- Emerging state: AI agents that monitor, alert, and recommend autonomously
- What this means for RGM teams (augmentation, not replacement)
- The competitive gap between early adopters and laggards is widening

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the evolution timeline
2. Phase 1: Excel era - manual, reactive, slow
3. Phase 2: BI Tools era - dashboards, faster but still reactive
4. Phase 3: Predictive Analytics - forecasting, some proactive capabilities
5. Phase 4: AI Agents - autonomous monitoring, recommendations, human-in-the-loop execution
6. Where most companies are today vs. where leaders are
7. What changes for RGM professionals (skills, workflows, impact)
8. CTA: "Where is your RGM capability today?" or "Explore RGM modernization"

THE EVOLUTION:

PHASE 1: EXCEL ERA (2000s-2015)
What it looked like:
- Spreadsheets for price/promo planning
- Manual data consolidation from multiple sources
- Post-promotion analysis taking weeks
- Gut-feel decisions supplemented by basic analysis

Limitations:
- Error-prone (formula mistakes, version control issues)
- Slow (analysis lags action by weeks/months)
- Not scalable (complexity overwhelms manual processes)
- Limited scope (can't analyze all SKUs/channels/regions)

PHASE 2: BI TOOLS ERA (2015-2020)
What it looked like:
- Tableau/Power BI dashboards
- Automated data pipelines (some)
- Faster access to historical data
- Better visualization of trends

Improvements:
- Faster reporting (days instead of weeks)
- Better data quality (fewer manual errors)
- More accessible insights (self-service)

Limitations:
- Still reactive (dashboards show what happened, not what to do)
- Requires expert interpretation
- Limited predictive capability
- Doesn't drive action

PHASE 3: PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS ERA (2020-2023)
What it looked like:
- Demand forecasting models
- Price elasticity analytics
- Promotional lift predictions
- What-if scenario planning

Improvements:
- Forward-looking (predict outcomes before acting)
- Quantified trade-offs (model impact of decisions)
- Optimized plans (find best price/promo mix)

Limitations:
- Still requires human to interpret and act
- Models need expert maintenance
- Often siloed by use case
- Complex to implement and sustain

PHASE 4: AI AGENTS ERA (2024+)
What it looks like:
- AI agents monitoring RGM metrics continuously
- Autonomous anomaly detection and alerting
- Proactive recommendations with rationale
- Human-in-the-loop approval and execution
- Adaptive learning from outcomes

Capabilities:
- Real-time monitoring: Continuous tracking of price, promo, mix, trade spend
- Exception-based management: Alerts only when action needed
- Contextual recommendations: "Here's what's wrong and what to do about it"
- Automated workflows: Agent handles data collection, analysis, draft recommendations
- Learning systems: Improve over time based on decision outcomes

Example workflows:
- Agent detects promotional underperformance 3 days in → alerts category manager → recommends tactical adjustments
- Agent identifies pricing opportunity based on competitor moves → models margin impact → presents recommendation
- Agent monitors trade spend vs. budget → flags overspend risk → suggests reallocation
- Agent tracks RGM KPIs → prepares business review materials → highlights exceptions

WHERE COMPANIES ARE TODAY:

LAGGARDS (40%):
- Still in Excel era
- Manual processes dominate
- Weeks for post-promotion analysis
- Reactive decision-making

MAINSTREAM (50%):
- BI Tools era
- Some automation, mostly dashboards
- Days for analysis
- Faster but still reactive

LEADERS (10%):
- Predictive Analytics or AI Agents
- Proactive recommendations
- Hours for insights
- Data-driven decision culture

THE GAP IS WIDENING:
Leaders making decisions 10x faster than laggards.
This compounds over time.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR RGM PROFESSIONALS:

SKILLS EVOLUTION:
- Less: Excel wizardry, manual data wrangling
- More: Business judgment, AI collaboration, strategic thinking

WORKFLOW CHANGES:
- From: Spend 80% time on analysis, 20% on decisions
- To: Spend 20% reviewing AI insights, 80% on strategy and execution

IMPACT MULTIPLICATION:
- One RGM manager with AI agents can cover 3x the scope
- Focus shifts from "what happened" to "what should we do"

VALUE CREATION:
- RGM teams become more strategic, less administrative
- Faster, better decisions drive measurable revenue impact
- Career path shifts toward commercial strategy

THE PATH FORWARD:
1. Assess: Where are you today? (Excel, BI, Predictive, or AI Agents)
2. Prioritize: Which RGM use cases deliver most value?
3. Pilot: Start with one agent (e.g., promotional monitoring)
4. Scale: Expand successful agents, retire manual processes
5. Evolve: Continuously improve based on outcomes

TONE: Educational, forward-looking, empowering (not threatening)
