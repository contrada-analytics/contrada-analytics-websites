LINKEDIN POST IDEA #14: From Sales Floors to Data Platforms: An Unconventional Path

TARGET AUDIENCE: Career-focused professionals, CPG practitioners, anyone interested in career pivots

HOOK:
I started in sales.
Then marketing.
Then platform engineering.
Then data leadership.

People ask, "How did that happen?"

Here's how - and why it matters.

KEY POINTS:
- Unconventional career path across sales, marketing, engineering, data
- Each role informed the next and created unique perspective
- The value of cross-functional experience in solving complex problems
- Why technical people should understand commercial reality (and vice versa)
- How this diverse background shapes your approach today

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the career path summary
2. Role 1: Sales - what you learned about customer reality
3. Role 2: Marketing - what you learned about positioning and messaging
4. Role 3: Platform engineering - what you learned about building scalable systems
5. Role 4: Data leadership - what you learned about organizational transformation
6. The synthesis: How all these perspectives create unique problem-solving ability
7. Real example: How this diverse background solved a specific client challenge
8. CTA: "What's your unconventional path?" or "Which role taught you the most?"

THE CAREER JOURNEY:

SALES (Early Career):
- Lessons: Customer needs are more nuanced than products suggest
- Reality: The gap between what systems deliver and what sellers need
- Key insight: If the tool doesn't help me close deals, I won't use it

MARKETING (Mid Career):
- Lessons: Positioning, messaging, understanding buyer psychology
- Reality: Data without story doesn't drive action
- Key insight: Features don't matter; outcomes do

PLATFORM ENGINEERING (Career Shift):
- Lessons: How to build scalable, reliable systems
- Reality: Technical elegance means nothing if users don't adopt
- Key insight: The best architecture is the one that gets used

DATA LEADERSHIP (Current):
- Lessons: Transformation is organizational, not just technical
- Reality: Culture eats technology for breakfast
- Key insight: People, process, then platform

THE SYNTHESIS:
- When building RGM platforms, I remember what it's like to be the sales rep who needs this data
- When designing AI systems, I consider the marketing manager who has to trust the insights
- When architecting solutions, I ensure they align with how commercial teams actually work
- This cross-functional perspective prevents the "technically perfect but never adopted" trap

REAL EXAMPLE:
Client wanted sophisticated ML model for promotional forecasting.
Sales background: Knew reps wouldn't trust a black box
Marketing background: Understood they needed "why" not just "what"
Engineering background: Built explainable AI with confidence intervals
Data leadership: Ensured organizational change management supported adoption
Result: System actually got used, delivered 18% ROI improvement

THE ADVANTAGE:
- Speak both commercial and technical languages fluently
- Design solutions that are feasible AND usable
- Bridge the gap that kills most projects
- Build trust with both business and technical stakeholders

TONE: Reflective, humble about the journey, clear about the value it creates
