LINKEDIN POST IDEA #2: Why Most AI Projects Fail in CPG (And How to Fix It)

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG executives, innovation leaders, digital transformation teams

HOOK:
I've watched dozens of AI projects deliver impressive demos... and then die.
Here's why (and how to avoid it).

KEY POINTS:
- Most AI failures aren't technical - they're organizational
- Common failure modes: no clear decision owner, solving the wrong problem, no integration with existing workflows
- Success requires: AI maturity assessment first, alignment with strategic initiatives, clear ROI path
- The "demo trap" - looks great in PowerPoint, never gets adopted

STRUCTURE:
1. Opening statement about AI project failure rate
2. Share personal observation from 20+ years in industry
3. List the 3-5 main reasons AI projects fail in CPG specifically
4. Contrast with what successful implementations have in common
5. Introduce framework: Assess → Align → Roadmap → Execute
6. CTA: "Download our AI Readiness Assessment" or "Which failure mode have you seen?"

KEY FRAMEWORKS TO MENTION:
- AI maturity across people, process, technology, governance
- Gap analysis: current capabilities vs. strategic needs
- Build vs. buy decision framework
- Prioritized roadmap linking AI investments to business outcomes

TONE: Experienced practitioner sharing hard-won lessons, not theoretical consultant
