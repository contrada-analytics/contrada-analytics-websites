LINKEDIN POST IDEA #12: Build vs Buy: AI Solutions for Mid-Market CPG

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG executives, technology leaders, finance/investment decision-makers

HOOK:
"Should we build or buy?"

I've heard this question 100 times from CPG leaders evaluating AI solutions.

Here's the framework I use to answer it.

KEY POINTS:
- Neither "always build" nor "always buy" is right - it depends on strategic value and feasibility
- Framework: Strategic differentiation vs. Complexity matrix
- Most CPG companies should buy commodity capabilities, build competitive differentiators
- Real ROI calculation includes opportunity cost and time-to-value
- Hybrid approach often optimal: platform + custom components

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the common dilemma
2. Introduce the decision framework (2x2 matrix)
3. Quadrant 1: Low differentiation, low complexity → BUY (e.g., BI tools, data warehouses)
4. Quadrant 2: High differentiation, low complexity → BUILD (e.g., custom RGM logic)
5. Quadrant 3: Low differentiation, high complexity → BUY (e.g., ERP systems)
6. Quadrant 4: High differentiation, high complexity → PARTNER or HYBRID
7. Real examples from CPG context
8. The hidden costs in each approach
9. CTA: "What are you trying to decide on?" or "Download build vs buy calculator"

THE DECISION FRAMEWORK:

ALWAYS BUY:
- Infrastructure (cloud, databases, networking)
- Commodity tools (BI, basic analytics, data visualization)
- Heavily regulated capabilities (security, compliance)
- Generic AI models (LLMs, computer vision)
- Reason: No competitive advantage, high maintenance burden

CONSIDER BUYING:
- Industry-specific platforms (trade promotion management)
- Established solutions with strong ecosystems
- Capabilities outside core competency
- Time-sensitive needs (faster than build)

CONSIDER BUILDING:
- Unique competitive differentiators (proprietary RGM algorithms)
- Specific workflows that match your unique process
- Integration layers between systems
- When existing solutions don't fit your business model

ALWAYS BUILD:
- Core IP and competitive advantage
- Capabilities that define your market position
- When no viable solution exists
- When strategic control is critical

REAL CPG EXAMPLES:
- Buy: Salesforce CRM, Tableau dashboards, AWS infrastructure
- Build: Proprietary promotional optimization engine, custom retailer integration
- Hybrid: Buy data platform (Snowflake), build custom RGM models on top

THE ROI CALCULATION:
Build costs: Development + ongoing maintenance + opportunity cost + talent acquisition
Buy costs: Licensing + implementation + customization + vendor dependency risk

TIME-TO-VALUE:
- Buy: Weeks to months
- Build: Months to years
- Hybrid: Months (platform) + weeks (custom components)
