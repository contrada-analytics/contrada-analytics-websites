LINKEDIN POST IDEA #8: "18 Data Sources, 3 Systems, 15 Countries - One Platform" - Case Study

TARGET AUDIENCE: Global CPG executives, supply chain leaders, data transformation teams

HOOK:
They had data everywhere.
ERP in Germany. Warehouse systems in Australia. Retailer portals across 15 countries.

Their RGM team was drowning.

Here's how we unified it.

KEY POINTS:
- Challenge: Global CPG manufacturer with fragmented data across regions and systems
- 18 different data sources across 3 core systems spanning 15 countries
- No unified view of RGM metrics, inventory, demand patterns, or supplier performance
- Result: Real-time tracking, +35% ASP growth, 62% reduction in stock-outs

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the complexity: 18 sources, 3 systems, 15 countries
2. The impact of fragmentation: regional teams making decisions without full picture
3. Specific failure story: Stock-out in key market because demand signal wasn't visible
4. The integration challenge: Different languages, currencies, business rules, data standards
5. Solution: Unified data platform connecting ERP, warehouse systems, retailer portals
6. Implementation: Phased rollout, region by region
7. Results: +35% ASP growth, -62% stock-outs, single source of truth for RGM
8. CTA: "Facing similar data fragmentation?" or "Download integration playbook"

TECHNICAL DETAILS (without being too technical):
- Real-time data synchronization
- Automated data quality checks
- Regional customization with global standardization
- Role-based dashboards for different user types

BUSINESS OUTCOMES:
- +35% ASP (Average Selling Price) growth
- 62% reduction in stock-outs
- Improved demand forecasting
- Better supplier negotiations (data-backed)
- Faster regional decision-making

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Start with one region/one use case, prove value, then scale
- Data governance must precede technology
- Regional buy-in is critical
