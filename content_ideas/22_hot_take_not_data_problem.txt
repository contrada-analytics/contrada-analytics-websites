LINKEDIN POST IDEA #22: Hot Take: Most CPG Brands Don't Have a Data Problem

TARGET AUDIENCE: CPG executives, transformation leaders, anyone frustrated with "data initiatives"

HOOK:
Hot take:

Most CPG brands don't have a data problem.

They have a decision-making problem.

Data is just the symptom.

KEY POINTS:
- Contrarian position: Data is rarely the root issue
- Real issues: unclear decision rights, slow approval processes, risk-averse culture, lack of empowerment
- Data becomes scapegoat for organizational dysfunction
- Fixing data without fixing decision-making = expensive failure
- Need to address both, but start with decision-making

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with the hot take
2. Present the common narrative ("we need better data")
3. Challenge it: What if data isn't the problem?
4. Reframe: The real bottlenecks in decision-making
5. Evidence: Companies with "worse" data that make better decisions
6. The pattern: Organizational issues masquerading as technical issues
7. How to diagnose: Is it data or decision-making?
8. The fix: Address decision-making first, then data
9. CTA: "Agree or disagree?" or "What's your experience?"

THE COMMON NARRATIVE:

"We can't make good decisions because we don't have good data"
"If only we had better dashboards..."
"We need to invest in a data lake/warehouse/platform..."
"Our data is scattered across too many systems..."
"We need more data scientists..."

SOUNDS FAMILIAR? HERE'S THE PROBLEM:

Even with perfect data, these companies still make slow, poor decisions.

Why?

THE REAL BOTTLENECKS:

BOTTLENECK #1: UNCLEAR DECISION RIGHTS
- Who decides? Multiple stakeholders, no clear owner
- Data is perfect, but 6 people need to agree
- Analysis-paralysis while seeking consensus
- Decision gets escalated unnecessarily

Example:
Should we accept this promotional proposal from Retailer X?
- Perfect data showing ROI
- Category manager says yes
- But needs approval from: Sales director, finance, RGM lead, GM
- 3 weeks and 5 meetings later, opportunity lost

THE ISSUE ISN'T DATA. IT'S GOVERNANCE.

BOTTLENECK #2: RISK-AVERSE CULTURE
- Need 100% certainty before deciding
- Fear of being wrong > cost of being slow
- Data becomes excuse to delay ("we need more analysis")
- Committees instead of decision-makers

Example:
AI model forecasts 85% confidence of promotional success
- Team wants to wait for 95% confidence
- Runs more analysis, builds more models
- Competitor moves first, captures the opportunity

THE ISSUE ISN'T DATA. IT'S CULTURE.

BOTTLENECK #3: LACK OF EMPOWERMENT
- Front-line teams closest to insights but can't act
- Decisions escalated unnecessarily
- By the time approval comes, market has moved
- Centralized decision-making doesn't scale

Example:
Account manager sees opportunity in retailer data
- Has the insight, knows the action
- Needs approval from 3 layers above
- 2 weeks later, gets permission
- Retailer has already allocated feature space elsewhere

THE ISSUE ISN'T DATA. IT'S ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE.

BOTTLENECK #4: PROCESS COMPLEXITY
- 17 steps to approve a promotional plan
- Multiple systems, handoffs, approvals
- Data exists but workflow is broken
- Decision velocity killed by process friction

Example:
Real-time data shows promotion underperforming
- Category manager knows what to do (tactical adjustment)
- But process requires: Create proposal → Finance review → Legal review → Executive approval
- By the time approved, promotion is over

THE ISSUE ISN'T DATA. IT'S PROCESS.

THE EVIDENCE:

I've seen companies with "worse" data make better decisions:

COMPANY A (Great data, slow decisions):
- Enterprise data warehouse
- Real-time dashboards
- Advanced analytics team
- Perfect data quality
- Decision cycle: 4-6 weeks
- Growth: Flat

COMPANY B (Good enough data, fast decisions):
- Connected spreadsheets
- Basic dashboards
- Small analytics team
- 80% data quality
- Decision cycle: Days
- Growth: 15% YoY

What's the difference? Decision-making culture and empowerment.

THE PATTERN:

Organizational dysfunction often masquerades as technical problems:

"We need better data" really means:
- "We can't agree on what to do" (decision rights issue)
- "We're afraid to act on the data we have" (risk culture issue)
- "We don't trust our people to decide" (empowerment issue)
- "Our process is too slow" (workflow issue)

Data becomes the scapegoat because it's easier to fix technology than culture.

THE DIAGNOSTIC:

Is it a data problem or decision-making problem?

Ask yourself:
1. If you had perfect data tomorrow, would decisions get made faster? (If no → decision-making problem)
2. Do you already have data that isn't being acted on? (If yes → decision-making problem)
3. Are decisions delayed by analysis or by approval? (If approval → decision-making problem)
4. Can front-line people make decisions or must they escalate? (If escalate → decision-making problem)
5. Do you need 95% certainty to act or is 80% enough? (If 95% → culture problem)

THE FIX:

ADDRESS DECISION-MAKING FIRST:

1. CLARIFY DECISION RIGHTS
- Who owns each type of decision?
- What's the threshold for escalation?
- Document and communicate

2. EMPOWER FRONT-LINE
- Push decisions down to people closest to the data
- Clear guidelines, then trust
- Monitor outcomes, not approvals

3. ACCELERATE PROCESS
- Remove unnecessary approval steps
- Parallel workflows instead of sequential
- Exception-based management (only escalate outliers)

4. SHIFT CULTURE
- Reward decision speed + learning, not just accuracy
- Make "good decision with available data" acceptable
- Distinguish reversible vs. irreversible decisions

THEN IMPROVE DATA:

5. AUTOMATE WHAT MATTERS
- Focus data investments on decisions with highest impact
- 80/20 rule: Automate the 20% that drives 80% of decisions
- Good enough data fast > perfect data slow

THE BOTTOM LINE:

Perfect data + slow decisions = Expensive reporting
Good enough data + fast decisions = Competitive advantage

Fix decision-making first. Then data.

ENGAGEMENT PROMPT:
"Agree or disagree? Is your bottleneck data or decision-making?"

TONE: Provocative but thoughtful, backed by real examples, invites discussion
